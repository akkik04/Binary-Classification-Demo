    "- Providing an implementation of logistic regression (binary classification algorithm) with a given scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "### SCENARIO:\n",
    "Suppose that selection for a field trip that a school is organizing is based on each applicant's last two exam results. We are the selection committee, and we want to determine each applicant’s chance of being selected based on their results on two exams. \n",
    "* Let's say we have historical data from previous applicants that is used as a training set for logistic regression. \n",
    "* For each training example, we have the applicant’s scores on two exams (two features) and the admissions decision (associated output label).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of selection for the field-trip based on the scores from those two exams. "
